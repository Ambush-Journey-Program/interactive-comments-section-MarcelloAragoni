## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

## **Your users should be able to:**

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- [ ] Upvote and downvote comments
- [ ] **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
